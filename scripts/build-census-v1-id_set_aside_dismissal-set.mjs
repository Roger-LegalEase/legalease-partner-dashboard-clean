/**
 * FABLE-PC census-v1 builder — Idaho set-aside and dismissal, I.C. § 19-2604(1).
 *
 *   node "scripts/build-census-v1-id_set_aside_dismissal-set.mjs" [--check] [--no-raster]
 *
 * THE CLASSIFICATION, READ FROM THE COMMITTED RECORDS
 *
 * An ORDINARY PARTICIPANT-FILED PACKET FAMILY, built as a custom pleading.
 * The census records the destination as the sentencing court — the court that
 * imposed or withheld sentence — and records that county practice on
 * § 19-2604 applications is unverified.
 *
 * A WARNING THE COMMITTED RECORD REQUIRES, AND THE PACKET CARRIES. The
 * registry's packet instructions record that a dismissal granted under
 * § 19-2604(1) PERMANENTLY DISQUALIFIES the record from § 67-3004(10) ISP
 * expungement, while not disqualifying it from Clean Slate shielding, and
 * that final dismissal restores civil rights without hiding the record. A
 * participant who files this without knowing that may give up a better
 * remedy, so both statements are on the filing instructions page.
 *
 * This route and I.C. § 19-2604(2) felony reduction are DIFFERENT ROUTES with
 * different families. Nothing in this packet is the reduction instrument.
 *
 * A built family is a built family. It is not verified, not approved, not
 * sellable, and this builder issues no verdict on its own packets.
