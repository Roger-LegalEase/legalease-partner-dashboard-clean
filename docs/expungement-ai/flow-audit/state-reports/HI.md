## Issues touching HI

- **UX-GLOBAL-001** (P0, `GLOBAL_NAVIGATION`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — Open matter and Complete packet information loop for any packet-ready matter whose paymentAllowed is false or whose commercialFlow cannot be reconstructed
- **UX-GLOBAL-002** (P1, `GLOBAL_SHARED_COMPONENT`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — Save this matter and continue performs two sequential network calls with no pending state on the button
- **UX-GLOBAL-003** (P1, `GLOBAL_NAVIGATION`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — Save this matter and continue always lands on the Briefcase list rather than on the saved matter's next step
- **UX-GLOBAL-004** (P1, `GLOBAL_FACT_MODEL`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — Facts already answered during screening are rendered again in the packet-information questionnaire, and the carry-forward is name-matched rather than guaranteed
- **UX-GLOBAL-005** (P1, `GLOBAL_FACT_MODEL`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — Contact information is collected as one free-text field that asks for a mailing address, a phone number and an email at once
- **UX-COURT-001** (P1, `COURT_DATA`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED_DATASET_THEN_PHASE_3_STATE_BINDING`) — Court is collected as free text with no state-aware selector and no controlled dataset behind it
- **UX-GLOBAL-006** (P2, `GLOBAL_FACT_MODEL`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — Full legal name is collected once, as a single text field, and only after the result and the save
- **UX-GLOBAL-008** (P1, `GLOBAL_REVIEW_FORMATTING`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — The accuracy review page formats exactly three internal values and prints every other snake_case answer verbatim
- **UX-GLOBAL-009** (P1, `GLOBAL_PAYMENT`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — No discount-code entry exists anywhere before checkout, and the only code the product accepts is a partner access code that grants a free packet
- **UX-GLOBAL-010** (P2, `GLOBAL_PAYMENT`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — Sponsorship is a server-side session property with no consumer entry point, so it cannot be distinguished from a discount by anyone using the product
- **UX-GLOBAL-011** (P1, `GLOBAL_HELP`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — Wilma receives a page-level context only; the current question, its prompt and its help copy are never passed
- **UX-GLOBAL-012** (P1, `GLOBAL_HELP`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — 3 sensitive question id(s) are asked with no helper text and no stated reason
- **UX-STATECFG-001** (P2, `STATE_CONFIGURATION`, owner `PHASE_3_STATE_SHARD`) — Route-specific facts are asked of every participant in the state before the route is known
- **UX-CONTENT-001** (P3, `CONTENT_ONLY`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — 5 question id(s) are served in the public profile payload with no eligibility, form, packet-selection or escalation consumer
- **UX-GLOBAL-015** (P3, `GLOBAL_SHARED_COMPONENT`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — Every jurisdiction's public profile carries other states' state-prefixed questions (51 jurisdictions affected)
- **UX-GLOBAL-016** (P2, `GLOBAL_SHARED_COMPONENT`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — The frontend contract states a contextOnly question never selects the pathway; the evaluator selects the pathway from one
- **UX-LEGAL-001** (P1, `REQUIRES_LEGAL_REVIEW`, owner `LEGAL_REVIEW_THEN_PHASE_3_STATE_SHARD`) — Selecting a state exclusion category still returns packet-ready in some jurisdictions, and so does the shortest timing bucket
- **UX-GLOBAL-017** (P1, `GLOBAL_NAVIGATION`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — A browser refresh discards every screening answer and restarts the flow at question one, with no warning and no recovery
- **UX-GLOBAL-018** (P2, `GLOBAL_REVIEW_FORMATTING`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — packet_ready and packet_ready_with_caution render an eyebrow that differs only by a full stop, under an identical title

## Files a Phase 3 shard may change for HI

```text
src/lib/rcap-engine/compiled/profiles/HI-hawaii.json
src/lib/rcap/state-packs/hawaii/**
docs/expungement-ai/flow-audit/state-reports/HI.md
```

Shared paths are Phase 2's and are listed in `data/expungement-ai/flow-audit/shard-assignment.json` under `prohibitedSharedPaths`.

## Phase 3 SHARD-2 — what this shard did

Base `93e05e945a52cfa1cdd2ab590636290875a48f68` (PHASE2_PRODUCT_HEAD). Evaluator clock pinned to `2026-07-01`. Full record: `data/expungement-ai/flow-audit/shard-results/SHARD-2.json`.

### Changed

- Added `src/lib/rcap/state-packs/hawaii/controlled-filing-dataset.ts`. Its court list is **deliberately empty**: Hawaii's compiled profile publishes an empty `packetGenerator.filingDestinationRules` and no court-naming source section, so there is no repository-backed destination to offer and none was invented.
- Added an additive `controlledDataBindings` block to `HI-hawaii.json` recording the gap.

### Deliberately not changed

- No question's id, stage, type, prompt, options, required flag, `contextOnly` flag or `doesNotSelectPathway` flag moved.
- No pathway, waiting-period rule, exclusion rule, ordered decision rule, packet family, form mapping, `operationallySellable` value or payment clamp moved.
- No waiting rule was authored and no binding was added. `src/lib/rcap-engine/waiting-rule-bindings.json` and `src/lib/rcap-engine/evaluator.ts` are prohibited paths and are untouched.
- No exclusion-category question was added, though Hawaii publishes six `exclusionRules` and no question that lets a participant declare one. That is recorded under UX-LEGAL-001, not implemented.
- UX-STATECFG-001 is recorded and not implemented: conditional rendering needs `deriveScreens`, a prohibited shared path.

### Terminals

No flow row moved. All 13 HI flow IDs keep the terminal they had at the base. Proved by regenerating the audit's own four generators at the base and again with this shard's changes applied: `flow-manifest.json`, `question-inventory.json`, `branch-coverage.json` and `ui-reachability.json` are byte-identical between the two runs.

### Reachability from the rendered screens only, at this base

- Rendered screens: **14**
- Packet-ready reachable: **yes**
- Payment reachable: **yes**
- Best terminal found: `packet_ready_with_caution`
- Facts the evaluator consumes that this state never asks: `record_documents`

### Waiting-rule dispositions

5 fallback-dependent route(s) assigned to this jurisdiction. Every one carries exactly one disposition. None is recommended ACTIVE.

| Route | Disposition | Rule(s) / basis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `deferred-acceptance-one-year` | `EXPLICIT_BINDING_PROPOSED` | `wait-01` |
| `deferred-prostitution-three-year` | `EXPLICIT_BINDING_PROPOSED` | `wait-02` |
| `dui-under-21-conviction` | `HELD_FOR_CORRECTION` | `wait-03` |
| `first-time-drug-conviction` | `LEGAL_OWNER_DECISION_REQUIRED` | no rule scoped to this route |
| `nonconviction-arrest-expungement` | `LEGAL_OWNER_DECISION_REQUIRED` | no rule scoped to this route |

### Duration-provenance findings

Structured durations in this jurisdiction's `waitingPeriodRules` that were extracted from something other than the operative wait:

- `wait-03` — duration **null**; the source sentence names HRS § 291E-0064(e) and states no period. Operative wait unknown. Live effect: payment open at every bucket for `dui-under-21-conviction`.

### Potential P0 payment / legal-outcome risks

- `HI:dui-under-21-conviction` — `packet_ready_with_caution` with `paymentAllowed` **true at every timing bucket including `lt_1_year`**. Its only rule, `wait-03`, carries no duration, so the timing answer is inert. Recommended **HOLD**.
- `HI:first-time-drug-conviction` — same pattern on a *conviction* disposition, with no published waiting rule scoped to the route at all. Recommended **HOLD**.

### Legal questions still open

Does HRS § 831-3.2 carry any ordinary waiting period; what governs first-time drug-offender and under-21 alcohol expungement; and should Hawaii publish an exclusion-category question so its six exclusionRules can bind.

### County and court (UX-COUNTY-001 / UX-COURT-001)

Classified `SHARED_PHASE2_BLOCKER`. One bounded state-configuration attempt was made and reproduced three blockers first-hand: the screening-parity gate refuses a compiled question's type and option list; the served payload comes from the shared all-51 designer fixture, so the change was inert; and `QuestionField.tsx` has no input combining a controlled list with manual entry. The attempt was reverted and not retried. What is preserved here is a **prepared dataset**, not a live customer-facing selector — the served profile and the renderer do not read it, and both are prohibited paths.
