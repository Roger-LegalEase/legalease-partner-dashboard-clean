### Terminal distribution across this jurisdiction's flow rows

| Terminal | Flows |
| --- | --- |
| `needs_review` | 7 |
| `hard_stop` | 2 |
| `guidance_only` | 2 |
| `needs_more_info` | 1 |

## Non-remedy terminals

| Probe | Terminal | What it exercises |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `inside_waiting_period` | `needs_review` | Participant's case resolved inside the shortest timing bucket the state offers. |
| `no_answers_supplied` | `needs_more_info` | Participant lands on the state's first screen and submits nothing. |
| `not_my_own_record` | `hard_stop` | Participant answers the ownership question with someone else's record. |
| `out_of_jurisdiction_case` | `hard_stop` | Participant's case is not a state or local case in this jurisdiction. |
| `state_exclusion_selected` | `needs_review` | Participant selects a state exclusion category on the exclusion screen. |

## Issues touching NV

- **UX-GLOBAL-002** (P1, `GLOBAL_SHARED_COMPONENT`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — Save this matter and continue performs two sequential network calls with no pending state on the button
- **UX-GLOBAL-003** (P1, `GLOBAL_NAVIGATION`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — Save this matter and continue always lands on the Briefcase list rather than on the saved matter's next step
- **UX-GLOBAL-005** (P1, `GLOBAL_FACT_MODEL`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — Contact information is collected as one free-text field that asks for a mailing address, a phone number and an email at once
- **UX-COURT-001** (P1, `COURT_DATA`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED_DATASET_THEN_PHASE_3_STATE_BINDING`) — Court is collected as free text with no state-aware selector and no controlled dataset behind it
- **UX-GLOBAL-006** (P2, `GLOBAL_FACT_MODEL`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — Full legal name is collected once, as a single text field, and only after the result and the save
- **UX-GLOBAL-007** (P2, `GLOBAL_FACT_MODEL`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — Current city duplicates the address already requested inside contact information
- **UX-GLOBAL-011** (P1, `GLOBAL_HELP`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — Wilma receives a page-level context only; the current question, its prompt and its help copy are never passed
- **UX-GLOBAL-012** (P1, `GLOBAL_HELP`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — 3 sensitive question id(s) are asked with no helper text and no stated reason
- **UX-CONTENT-001** (P3, `CONTENT_ONLY`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — 5 question id(s) are served in the public profile payload with no eligibility, form, packet-selection or escalation consumer
- **UX-GLOBAL-015** (P3, `GLOBAL_SHARED_COMPONENT`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — Every jurisdiction's public profile carries other states' state-prefixed questions (51 jurisdictions affected)
- **UX-GLOBAL-016** (P2, `GLOBAL_SHARED_COMPONENT`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — The frontend contract states a contextOnly question never selects the pathway; the evaluator selects the pathway from one
- **UX-GLOBAL-017** (P1, `GLOBAL_NAVIGATION`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — A browser refresh discards every screening answer and restarts the flow at question one, with no warning and no recovery

## Files a Phase 3 shard may change for NV

```text
src/lib/rcap-engine/compiled/profiles/NV-nevada.json
src/lib/rcap/state-packs/nevada/**
docs/expungement-ai/flow-audit/state-reports/NV.md
```

Shared paths are Phase 2's and are listed in `data/expungement-ai/flow-audit/shard-assignment.json` under `prohibitedSharedPaths`.

## Phase 3 Shard 2 disposition

- `wait-09` describes no stipulation or objection “within 30 days” after the petition. That is a prosecutor response window, not an eligibility wait; its structured duration is now null.
- At a 122-day probe, forcing `wait-09` previously returned `packet_ready_with_caution`/true while the operative five-year offense-class rule returned `not_yet`/false. The corrected procedural rule now fails closed. Classify as a potential P0 payment risk and hold general conviction sealing until the shared binding is route- and class-specific.
- Controlled-substance three-year and reentry four-year proposals are explicit. The other five fallback routes remain held or require a legal-owner decision. Court work is `SHARED_PHASE2_BLOCKER`.
