| `guidance_only` | 6 |
| `needs_review` | 3 |
| `hard_stop` | 2 |
| `needs_more_info` | 1 |

## Non-remedy terminals

| Probe | Terminal | What it exercises |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `inside_waiting_period` | `guidance_only` | Participant's case resolved inside the shortest timing bucket the state offers. |
| `no_answers_supplied` | `needs_more_info` | Participant lands on the state's first screen and submits nothing. |
| `not_my_own_record` | `hard_stop` | Participant answers the ownership question with someone else's record. |
| `out_of_jurisdiction_case` | `hard_stop` | Participant's case is not a state or local case in this jurisdiction. |
| `state_exclusion_selected` | `guidance_only` | Participant selects a state exclusion category on the exclusion screen. |

## Issues touching SC

- **UX-GLOBAL-002** (P1, `GLOBAL_SHARED_COMPONENT`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — Save this matter and continue performs two sequential network calls with no pending state on the button
- **UX-GLOBAL-003** (P1, `GLOBAL_NAVIGATION`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — Save this matter and continue always lands on the Briefcase list rather than on the saved matter's next step
- **UX-GLOBAL-005** (P1, `GLOBAL_FACT_MODEL`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — Contact information is collected as one free-text field that asks for a mailing address, a phone number and an email at once
- **UX-COURT-001** (P1, `COURT_DATA`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED_DATASET_THEN_PHASE_3_STATE_BINDING`) — Court is collected as free text with no state-aware selector and no controlled dataset behind it
- **UX-GLOBAL-006** (P2, `GLOBAL_FACT_MODEL`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — Full legal name is collected once, as a single text field, and only after the result and the save
- **UX-GLOBAL-011** (P1, `GLOBAL_HELP`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — Wilma receives a page-level context only; the current question, its prompt and its help copy are never passed
- **UX-GLOBAL-012** (P1, `GLOBAL_HELP`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — 3 sensitive question id(s) are asked with no helper text and no stated reason
- **UX-GLOBAL-013** (P0, `GLOBAL_SHARED_COMPONENT`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — The automatic waiting-rule selector cannot choose a rule the profile already contains, closing 13 jurisdictions that are otherwise reachable and payable
- **UX-STATELAW-001** (P1, `STATE_LEGAL_LOGIC`, owner `LEGAL_REVIEW_THEN_PHASE_3_STATE_SHARD`) — 19 jurisdictions reach no packet-ready outcome when the audit answers only the screens the flow renders
- **UX-CONTENT-001** (P3, `CONTENT_ONLY`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — 5 question id(s) are served in the public profile payload with no eligibility, form, packet-selection or escalation consumer
- **UX-GLOBAL-015** (P3, `GLOBAL_SHARED_COMPONENT`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — Every jurisdiction's public profile carries other states' state-prefixed questions (51 jurisdictions affected)
- **UX-GLOBAL-016** (P2, `GLOBAL_SHARED_COMPONENT`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — The frontend contract states a contextOnly question never selects the pathway; the evaluator selects the pathway from one
- **UX-GLOBAL-017** (P1, `GLOBAL_NAVIGATION`, owner `PHASE_2_SHARED`) — A browser refresh discards every screening answer and restarts the flow at question one, with no warning and no recovery
