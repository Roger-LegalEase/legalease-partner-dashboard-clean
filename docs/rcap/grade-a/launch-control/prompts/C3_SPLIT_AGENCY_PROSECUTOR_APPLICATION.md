# C3_SPLIT_AGENCY_PROSECUTOR_APPLICATION

**Archetype:** Agency or prosecutor-controlled stage plus participant application or request
**Lane:** category-b-implementation
**Worker branch:** `codex/c3-split-agency-prosecutor-application`
**Branch from:** `227f095d5d1493feca56779cf60c6f177caebd61` (the control baseline — branch from exactly this commit)
**Repository:** Roger-LegalEase/legalease-partner-dashboard-clean

## Mission

An agency or prosecutor controls the stage, and the participant's branch is an application or request into it. Build the branch identity and the destination that actually receives it.

## Your exact scope — 4 routes

| Route key | Reuse decision | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `obligation:track-only:AK:ak-nonconviction-confidential` | NO_EXISTING_WORK | the instrument names no form number, so no form-level crosswalk could be attempted; this is 'no match attempted', not 'no match exists' |
| `obligation:track-only:MD:md_10112_dpscs_cannabis` | REUSE_AS_IS | an existing Category A route already requires this instrument (obligation:track-pathway:MD:md_10105_favorable:adult-non-conviction-expungement-under-crim-proc-10-105); crosswalk it rather than creating a second route |
| `obligation:track-only:MI:mi_arrest_no_charge` | NO_EXISTING_WORK | no existing Category A route in this jurisdiction requires any form this instrument names |
| `obligation:track-pathway:NY:ny_clean_slate_convictions:automatic-clean-slate-sealing-under-cpl-160-57` | REUSE_AS_IS | an existing Category A route already requires this instrument (obligation:track-pathway:NY:ny_160_59_petition:discretionary-conviction-sealing-by-petition-under-cpl-160-59); crosswalk it rather than creating a second route |

## Packet families implicated

These families are NAMED by this lane and created by nobody in this wave. A jurisdiction's family is shared across archetypes, so three lanes each creating it would produce three conflicting families for one jurisdiction.

- `rcap-ak-participant-agency-application`
- `rcap-md-official-pdf-fill`
- `rcap-mi-official-pdf-fill`
- `rcap-ny-official-pdf-fill`

Nothing outside this scope belongs to you. Every row here is allocated to you and to no other lane; the dispatch refuses to generate if two lanes claim one row.

## Required inputs

- `data/rcap-grade-a/launch-control/GRADE_A_LAUNCH_CONTROL.json`
- `data/rcap-grade-a/launch-control/GRADE_A_LAUNCH_STATUS.md`
- `data/rcap-grade-a/launch-control/EXISTING_WORK_REUSE_INDEX.json`
- `data/rcap-grade-a/launch-control/ACTIVE_CODEX_ASSIGNMENTS.json`

## Owned paths — write only here

## Prohibited paths — never write here

- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- `.github/workflows/**`

## Required outputs

- data/rcap-grade-a/category-b-integration/c3-split-agency-prosecutor-application/branch-identities.json — one record per assigned route: the retained B stage, the participant A branch, and for each the selector, output strategy, product outcome and commercial treatment, stated as four different things
- data/rcap-grade-a/category-b-integration/c3-split-agency-prosecutor-application/crosswalks.json — for every route whose reuse decision is REUSE_AS_IS, the existing Category A route it binds to and the evidence for the binding
- data/rcap-grade-a/category-b-integration/c3-split-agency-prosecutor-application/README.md — what each branch files, where it goes, what triggers it and what the deadline is

## Focused tests

- `node scripts/grade-a-launch-control/generate-category-b-integration-delta.mjs --check`
- `node scripts/grade-a-launch-control/verify-launch-control.mjs`
- `npm run typecheck`

Do not run a broad tracked-file mutation suite: other workers are active, and a mutation harness that leaves a tracked file altered fails their runs, not only yours.

## Stop conditions

- A route whose participant instrument names no document you can identify from a committed record stops and is reported unresolved. Naming a form you have not seen sends a participant to file the wrong thing.
- A route whose reuse decision is REUSE_AS_IS and whose crosswalk you cannot confirm stops. Reporting a crosswalk that does not hold silently drops a participant branch nothing else covers.
- A B stage and its A branch that would end up sharing a selector, an output strategy, a product outcome or a commercial treatment stops. They are two different things; if they collapse into one, the automatic stage becomes purchasable.

Stopping with an honest account of what is missing is a complete return. A result reported as done on evidence nobody opened is not.

## Return format

```text
ASSIGNMENT:
WORKER BRANCH:
BASE SHA:
COMMIT:
ROUTES COMPLETED:
CROSSWALKS CONFIRMED:
NEW BRANCH IDENTITIES CREATED:
PACKET FAMILIES NAMED (not created):
STOPPED AND REPORTED:
COMMERCIAL ROUTES OPENED: 0
PRODUCTION TOUCHED: NO
```

## What finishing does not do

Completing this assignment opens no commercial route, proves no packet and approves no output. Commercial authority comes from a Grade-A fulfilment record keyed to an exact route and packet family, and from nothing else.

## Setup

```sh
git fetch origin --prune
git checkout -b codex/c3-split-agency-prosecutor-application 227f095d5d1493feca56779cf60c6f177caebd61
npm ci --cache /tmp/legalease-npm-cache
```

Commit your work and `git push -u origin codex/c3-split-agency-prosecutor-application`.
