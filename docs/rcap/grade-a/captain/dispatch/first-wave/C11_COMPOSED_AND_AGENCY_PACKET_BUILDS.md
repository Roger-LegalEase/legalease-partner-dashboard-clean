# C11_COMPOSED_AND_AGENCY_PACKET_BUILDS

**Lane:** packet
**Worker branch:** `codex/first-wave-c11-composed-and-agency-packet-builds`
**Branch from:** `bc504a3e1b160e153a7393ed8673f3e784c0a8c7` (the control baseline — branch from exactly this commit)
**Repository:** Roger-LegalEase/legalease-partner-dashboard-clean

## Mission

Build composed-pleading and agency-application families whose source is already held. 4 families qualify.

## Your exact scope — 4 worklistGroupIds

- `ne-setaside-noncustodial-set`
- `oh_marijuana_expungement-set`
- `pa_6308_underage-set`
- `rcap-oh-custom-pleading-clean-tracks`

Nothing outside this list belongs to you. Every row here is allocated to you
and to no other lane; the dispatch refuses to generate if two lanes claim one
row.

## Required inputs

- `data/rcap-grade-a/launch-control/LAUNCH_CONTROL.json`
- `data/rcap-grade-a/launch-control/reuse-index.json`
- `data/rcap-grade-a/route-obligation-census-v1/FREEZE.json`

## Owned paths — write only here

- `data/rcap-all50/pleadings/**  (only the families listed below)`

## Prohibited paths — never write here

- `data/rcap-grade-a/route-obligation-census-candidate/category-b-medium-confidence-revalidation.json`
- `docs/rcap/grade-a/route-obligation-census/CATEGORY_B_MEDIUM_CONFIDENCE_REVALIDATION.md`
- `data/rcap-grade-a/route-obligation-census-v1/FREEZE.json`
- `data/rcap-grade-a/launch-control/**`
- `data/rcap-ledger/**`
- `supabase/migrations/**`
- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- `.github/workflows/**`

## Expected outputs

- one pleading configuration, fixtures, rendered output and participant instructions per family

## Focused tests

- `node scripts/grade-a-launch-control/verify-launch-control.mjs`

Do not run a broad tracked-file mutation suite: other workers are active and a
mutation harness that leaves a tracked file altered will fail their runs, not
only yours.

## Stop conditions

A family whose output vehicle is unresolved in its legal-design memo stops and is reported; the vehicle is a legal-design decision, not a build choice.

Stopping with an honest account of what is missing is a complete return. A
result reported as done on evidence nobody opened is not.

## What finishing does not do

Completing this assignment opens no commercial route, proves no packet and approves no output. Commercial authority comes from a Grade-A fulfilment record
keyed to an exact route and packet family, and from nothing else.

## Setup

```sh
git fetch origin --prune
git checkout -b codex/first-wave-c11-composed-and-agency-packet-builds bc504a3e1b160e153a7393ed8673f3e784c0a8c7
npm ci --cache /tmp/legalease-npm-cache
```

Commit your work and `git push -u origin codex/first-wave-c11-composed-and-agency-packet-builds`.
