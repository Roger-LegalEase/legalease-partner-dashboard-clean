# C12_DATA_RIGHTS_HOSTED_ENVIRONMENT

**Lane:** platform
**Worker branch:** `codex/first-wave-c12-data-rights-hosted-environment`
**Branch from:** `bc504a3e1b160e153a7393ed8673f3e784c0a8c7` (the control baseline — branch from exactly this commit)

## Mission

Stand up the synthetic nonproduction acceptance environment for participant data rights and run hosted export, matter-deletion and account-deletion acceptance against it.

## Your exact scope — 0 environments

_This lane is scoped by the census rather than by an explicit row list; its scope is stated in the mission._

Nothing outside this list belongs to you. Every row here is allocated to you
and to no other lane; the dispatch refuses to generate if two lanes claim one
row.

## Required inputs

- `data/rcap-grade-a/launch-control/LAUNCH_CONTROL.json`
- `data/rcap-grade-a/launch-control/reuse-index.json`
- `data/rcap-grade-a/route-obligation-census-v1/FREEZE.json`

## Owned paths — write only here

- `data/rcap-grade-a/participant-data-rights/**`

## Prohibited paths — never write here

- `data/rcap-grade-a/route-obligation-census-candidate/category-b-medium-confidence-revalidation.json`
- `docs/rcap/grade-a/route-obligation-census/CATEGORY_B_MEDIUM_CONFIDENCE_REVALIDATION.md`
- `data/rcap-grade-a/route-obligation-census-v1/FREEZE.json`
- `data/rcap-grade-a/launch-control/**`
- `data/rcap-ledger/**`
- `supabase/migrations/**`
- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- `.github/workflows/**`

## Expected outputs

- data/rcap-grade-a/participant-data-rights/hosted-acceptance.json

## Focused tests

- `node scripts/verify-participant-data-rights.mjs`
- `node scripts/grade-a-launch-control/verify-launch-control.mjs`

Do not run a broad tracked-file mutation suite: other workers are active and a
mutation harness that leaves a tracked file altered will fail their runs, not
only yours.

## Stop conditions

SYNTHETIC NONPRODUCTION ONLY. No Production migration, deployment, environment-variable change or real participant data. The authorization covers one dedicated synthetic acceptance project and nothing else; if the project ref cannot be recorded and proven synthetic, this lane stops rather than proceeding.

Stopping with an honest account of what is missing is a complete return. A
result reported as done on evidence nobody opened is not.

## What finishing does not do

Completing this assignment opens no commercial route, proves no packet and approves no output. Commercial authority comes from a Grade-A fulfilment record
keyed to an exact route and packet family, and from nothing else.

## Setup

```sh
git fetch origin --prune
git checkout -b codex/first-wave-c12-data-rights-hosted-environment bc504a3e1b160e153a7393ed8673f3e784c0a8c7
npm ci --cache /tmp/legalease-npm-cache
```

Commit your work and `git push -u origin codex/first-wave-c12-data-rights-hosted-environment`.
