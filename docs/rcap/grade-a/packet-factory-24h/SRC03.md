# SRC03

**Environment:** LegalEase Packet Factory (Codex Cloud)  ·  **Lane:** source-swarm
**Repository branch to select:** `claude/legalease-sprint-captain-utucnw`
**Branch in the container:** `work` — Codex Cloud names it. Do not rename it and do not create another.
**Minimum required ancestor:** `7476708c6236b7b2ce1b1112dbeef434d3957c59` (or the newer dispatch base)
**Execution contract:** `docs/rcap/grade-a/launch-control/CODEX_CLOUD_PACKET_EXECUTION.md` — read it before you start.
**Repository:** Roger-LegalEase/legalease-partner-dashboard-clean

> There is no origin, the checkout is shallow, and your finished diff returns through the Codex Cloud interface. That is the design.

## Before anything else

```sh
source $HOME/.legalease-corpus-env
node scripts/verify-packet-build-environment.mjs \
  --family ar-act531-set::official-form:ACIC-ORDER-SEAL-ACT-531-ACT-1460 \
  --codex-cloud \
  --minimum-captain-sha 7476708c6236b7b2ce1b1112dbeef434d3957c59
```

It must print **`PACKET_BUILD_ENVIRONMENT_READY: 14/14`**. A 13/14 in cloud mode is a real failure, not the shallow checkout being tolerated.

## Never run these

- `git fetch`
- `git pull`
- `git push`
- `gh `
- `git worktree`
- `git remote add`
- `git clone`

## Claim before you read

- Assert every family before reading or writing anything: `node scripts/grade-a-packet-factory-24h/claim.mjs --assert SRC03 <familyId>`
- A non-zero exit is a full stop for that family: report `BLOCKED_BEFORE_CLAIM` naming the exact refusal, and read none of its artifacts.
- Release each family when it is finished: `node scripts/grade-a-packet-factory-24h/claim.mjs --release SRC03 <familyId>`, and leave that in your diff.

## How to raster

- Page rasters go through `scripts/lib/pdf-page-raster.mjs`. It discovers its own browser and calibrates the page-to-pixel mapping against both the paper bounds and stamped marks.
- NEVER `pdftoppm`. NEVER `apt-get`. NEVER `playwright install`. The environment refuses package installation and a Poppler fallback is not a fallback, it is a different measurement.
- The preflight now gates on the rasterizer resolving a browser it can execute, so a lane that cannot raster learns before it builds rather than after.

## Mission

Reconcile a named form number or pinned content hash against the private corpus and the committed inventory, and bind it by exact SHA-256 where the bytes are already held. A form the corpus already carries needs no acquisition.

## What bounds this lane

the private corpus and the committed inventory, read only — nothing is fetched here

**46 obligations · 15 families this lane WOULD release if every one of them resolves · hosts: AR, DE, HI, MT, NE, NM, UT**

> Prospective. Nothing below is promoted custody yet, and this number is not a count of families you can build today.

> This environment refuses outbound egress to court and agency hosts. Identity and inventory work runs here; anything needing a fetch is dispatched through the acquisition workflow, never attempted locally and never faked.

## Required outputs

- data/rcap-grade-a/packet-factory-24h/src03/rows.json — one row per obligation: itemId, status, the identity or receipt, and the families it releases
- data/rcap-grade-a/source-acquisition/packet-factory-24h/src03/receipts.json — the eleven recorded fields per resolved source; no body is committed

### Output schema

Array key `rows`, item key `itemId`, status words: `COMPLETED`, `STOPPED`.

An unrecognised status is refused at integration rather than translated.

## Focused tests

- `node scripts/grade-a-packet-factory-24h/verify.mjs`

> Focused checks only. The full national repository chain runs at Captain checkpoints, never inside a worker.

## Stop conditions

- NEVER guess a form number and never accept an unofficial mirror. A secondary copy does not override an available official original.
- NEVER commit a source body, an extracted archive or anything under private/. A receipt carrying an exact hash is the deliverable.
- NEVER promote a source without exact bytes. A promotion is a release, and a released family goes to a builder that will try to open the file.
- LANE STOP — you build no packet and you touch no overlay directory.
- ROW STOP — an obligation that cannot be settled here is STOPPED naming the exact host and the next operation that owns it.

Stopping with an honest account of what is missing is a complete return. One blocked family never stops the lane.

## How you return

Commit locally. Leave the final diff for the Codex Cloud interface. There is no PUSHED line in a cloud return.

## What finishing does not do

A bound source is a bound source. It builds nothing, proves nothing and approves nothing.
